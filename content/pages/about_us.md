Title: About Us

AdMasterMind was started by two [IITians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology "Indian Institute of Technology") in the [Silicon Valley of India](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_of_India "Bangalore Silicon Valley of India") to solve problems faced by advertisers.

Marketing and Technology are two things we heart and we believe great things can be achieved by combining the power of these two. Marketing has a lot of hard problems and as Engineers we believe however hard the problems are we can break it down to numerous small easy problems.

Google AdWords is the first online marketing channel where we want to focus our energies. Efficiently running AdWords Campaign is a tough problem to solve. We have hence gone ahead and created internal tools which solves a small part of this huge problem well.

Our experience with Google AdWords has taught us that process oriented changes have huge beneficial impact on the efficiency of AdWords campaigns. We will use all the knowledge acquired over the years as well as cutting edge tools to eek out maximum performance from AdWords Campaigns of our clients.

In the coming months, we hope to release all the adwords tools developed by us one by one for the entire world to use. Stay tuned for awesomeness.
