Title: SEM Tools

###The tools we offer are :###

1. ####Campaign Creation####
   
    Campaign creation is a very important step in creating good AdWords campaigns. When keywords are segregated manually into different AdGroups and campaigns, there is a very high probability of errors creeping in to the campaign setup. On manual creation of campaigns, one can easily miss well known guidelines.
     
    Our Tool incorporates best practices like:
     
    * Different AdGroups for different match-types 
    * Proper use of negative keywords
    * Creation of long tail keywords and more

2. ####Bid Optimization####

    Although there are a few bid management tools in the market, all of them try to optimize on a keyword level.  
    Our tool looks at the account as a whole instead of looking at individual keywords. This gives a much better ROI to the advertiser.

3. ####Campaign Quality Score####

    It is difficult for an individual to look at a huge campaign and identify which AdGroups or keywords need immediate attention.   
    Our tool identifies the areas that need immediate attention and suggests changes to be done. It also looks at the terms people are searching for and suggests possible improvements in the campaign structure.

4. ####Search Term Analysis####
    
    Breaking down running campaigns to further focused ad groups is another problem which is faced by an individual. 
    For this he is required to dig into the search terms and create ad groups. This process is lengthy and time consuming.
    Our tool goes through the existing campaign structure and the weekly search term report and suggests all additions.
